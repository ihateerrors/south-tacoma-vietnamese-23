            Right now, residents can reach Lakewood Station from the north via
            Kendrick Street or via a long route on Bridgeport Way and Pacific
            Highway South. The new path at the end of 115th would make this trip

                      There is a route made up of a solid line with an arrow at
                      the end that travels down 112th Street Southwest along
                      Bridgeport Way Southwest to Pacific Highway Southwest and
                      then travels east to the station. Another solid line route
                      travels from 112th Street Southwest down Kendrick Street
                      Southwest until reaching the pedestrian bridge that
                      crosses over the Sounder South Line from Lakewood to
                      Seattle rail tracks and goes to Lakewood Station. Both of
                      these routes are labeled as being current walking/rolling
                      routes to the station. Another route is on the map, which
                      begins at the intersection of Bridgeport Way Southwest and
                      115th Street Court Southwest and extends east along 115th
                      Street Court Southwest to the end of the cul-de- sac.

                    <p>
                      The route extends beyond the cul-de-sac and ends at the
                      pedestrian bridge. This route is labeled as a potential
                      future route to Lakewood station. Two bus stops are also
                      indicated on the map on either side of Bridgeport Way
                      Southwest near the 115th Street Court Southwest
                      intersection. Bicycle facilities are indicated on the map
                      along Lakeview Avenue Southwest to Kendrick Street
                      Southwest terminating at the pedestrian bridge. Bike
                      sharrows are also indicated on the map along Bridgeport
                      Way Southwest from Pacific Highway Southwest to beyond the
                      extent of the map to the north. Sharrows are also
                      indicated along 112th Street Southwest between Bridgeport
                      Way Southwest and Kendrick Street Southwest. Pierce
                      Transit bus route 206 is indicated along Bridgeport Way
                      Southwest along the full extent of the map from north to

                Zac Eskenazi, project manager for Sound Transit, says, “We’re
                excited about the proposed Bridgeport Way and 115th connections
                because the connections open up a much more direct way to get to
                the station to take the Sounder train or buses. The new

                    115th Street Court Southwest is located in the middle of the
                    map, with the west and east boundaries being Bridgeport Way
                    southwest and 115th Street cul de sac respectively. Colored
                    lines and icons are used to indicate proposed changes on the
                    graphic, including sidewalks, sharrows, a shared use path, a
                    signalized crossing, and Route 206 and associated bus stop
                    improvements.

                  <p>
                    Bus stops improvements are indicated on the east and west
                    side of the street just north and south of 115th. A
                    signalized crossing is proposed on the northside of 115th
                    across Bridgeport Way Southwest.

                  <p>
                    Sharrows are proposed along 115th Street Court Southwest
                    from Bridgeport Way Southwest to the cul de sac just north
                    of the Sounder rail. Sharrows are labeled with a pedestrian
                    and car icon. Sidewalks are also proposed along the
                    northside of 115th from the west of the Cascade Village
                    Apartment complex and around the circumference of the cul de
                    sac. Sidewalks are labeled with a pedestrian icon.

                  <p>
                    A shared use path is proposed adjacent to the Sounder rail
                    heading northeast-bound. The shared use path is labeled with
                    bicycle and pedestrian icons.

                  The Bridgeport Way and 115th connections include a new

                  sidewalks, sharrows and other improvements on 115th Street
                  Court SW. The improvement also includes a shared use path that
                  connects walkers, bicyclists, and rollers to Lakewood Station
                  via 115th. &nbsp;&nbsp;| &nbsp;&nbsp;Click to enlarge

            We are also proposing the addition of a pedestrian/bike activated
            signal to help people cross Bridgeport Way at the intersection with
            115th Street Court SW, where Pierce Transit Route 206 stops. Other
            upgrades on 115th St. Ct. SW include more sidewalks and curb ramps,
            sharrows, wayfinding signage and a new passenger pickup/drop-off
            area at the cul-de-sac at the end of 115th St. Ct. SW.
          </p>
          <p>
            Eskenazi says, “Coupled with better wayfinding signs, these
            improvements could really improve access for people taking transit
            in the area and trying to access the station. Whether that’s to take
            a game train to watch the Seahawks, or to commute to work, or to
            take a regional bus, we think this connection is super important.”

            After the project finishes environmental review later this year, the
            Sound Transit Board will select the improvements to build. If the
            Bridgeport Way and 115th connections are selected, Sound Transit
            would construct the

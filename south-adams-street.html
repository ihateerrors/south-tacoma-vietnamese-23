                  South Adams Street is a major access route for getting to
                  South Tacoma Station and is also home to local residents,
                  businesses, and destinations for community recreation. It
                  currently has discontinuous and aging sidewalks on the east
                  side of the street and a section of newer sidewalk on the west
                  side, but only from South 66th Street to the southern SERA
                  Campus parking lot. The goal for the South Adams Street
                  connections is to ensure that people of all ages and abilities
                  can safely walk, bike, or roll to South Tacoma Station and
                  SERA Campus.

              In terms of bicycle access today, South Adams Street has sharrows,
              or road markings for bikes to share the street with cars. Last
              year we studied adding

                title="A protected bike lane has some form of physical separation between bicyclists and motor vehicle travel lanes, like parked cars, bollards, or curbs, but the bike lane is still part of the roadway. "
              >
                protected bike lanes
              </button>
              on the west side of South Adams Street from South 58th Street to
              South 66th Street. Another name for this is a two-way cycle track,
              as there would be bike lanes in both directions on one side of the
              street. Building protected bike lanes on South Adams Street would
              require removing on-street parking from
              one side of the street. When Sound Transit started talking with
              community members about this proposal during outreach in 2022, we
              heard concerns from local businesses about on-street parking loss

                        There is a route made up of a solid line with an arrow
                        at the end that travels down 112th Street Southwest
                        along Bridgeport Way Southwest to Pacific Highway
                        Southwest and then travels east to the station. Another
                        solid line route travels from 112th Street Southwest
                        down Kendrick Street Southwest until reaching the
                        pedestrian bridge that crosses over the Sounder South
                        Line from Lakewood to Seattle rail tracks and goes to
                        Lakewood Station. Both of these routes are labeled as
                        being current walking/rolling routes to the station.

                        intersection of Bridgeport Way Southwest and 115th
                        Street Court Southwest and extends east along 115th

                        pedestrian bridge. This route is labeled as a potential
                        future route to Lakewood station. Two bus stops are also
                        indicated on the map on either side of Bridgeport Way
                        Southwest near the South Adams Street Court Southwest
                        intersection. Bicycle facilities are indicated on the
                        map along Lakeview Avenue Southwest to Kendrick Street

                <h3>How have the proposed improvements changed?</h3>
                <p>
                  Our proposed improvements for South Adams Street include
                  filling in the missing sidewalks and curb ramps on the east
                  side of South Adams from South 66th Street to South 56th
                  Street. For the west side of the street, we’ve refined two
                  concepts from last year into one hybrid design for further
                  study that combines some pedestrian and bike facilities.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Section 1: In the southern end of the corridor (South 66th
                    Street to the north end of the south SERA parking lot),
                    we’re proposing to construct on-street protected bike lanes.
                    Parking would be removed on the west side of the street in
                    this vicinity (approximately 30 stalls) to make room for the
                    protected bike lanes.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Section 2: Between the south SERA parking lot and S 60th
                    Street we’re proposing a shared use path on the SERA Campus.
                    The shared use path would require a partnership with Metro
                    Parks Tacoma and would not affect on-street parking. It
                    would be used by pedestrians and bicyclists and separated
                    from cars.
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        Our environmental findings show that some landscaping or
                        trees along the east edge of SERA Campus may need to be
                        removed in this area. We would comply with replacement
                        requirements as necessary.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        We would also fill in missing sidewalks and curb ramps
                        on the west side of South Adams Street from South 60th
                        Street to South 56th Street.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <p>
                This new approach for the west side of South Adams Street will
                provide better connections for people walking, biking, and
                rolling in the area and will result in less on-street parking
                loss (approximately 30 spaces) compared to the full two-way
                cycle track option, which would have removed over 90 spaces.

              The South Adams Street connections also include other important
              upgrades for pedestrian and transit access, like upgrading curb
              ramps to meet ADA standards, an enhanced pedestrian crossing on
              South 66 Street at the intersection with South Adams Street
              (installing a crosswalk with a pedestrian/bike activated signal),
              and bus stop upgrades near South 66 Street and South Adams Street
              (served by Pierce Transit Route 53) to include a bench and other
              improvements.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our preliminary cost estimate for these improvements is in the $1
              million to $3 million range. As a Priority 1 improvement, we
              anticipate being able to fund these changes unless there are
              unforeseen challenges with design or construction costs. After the
              project’s environmental review finishes early next year, the Sound
              Transit Board will select the improvements to build. All
              improvements are expected to be completed by 2030.
